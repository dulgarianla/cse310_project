# Overview

Welcome to the WizzieWizard store! Here you can buy all things wizard! Looking for a new broom? We got you! We have pets, magical items, and also wizard clothing!

We decided to create this website for like-minded wizards out there. We thought it would be cool to set up a wizard store for anyone to access!
